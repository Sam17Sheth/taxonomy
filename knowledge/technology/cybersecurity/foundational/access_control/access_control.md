# Access Control in CMMC 2.0

## Overview
Access Control (AC) is a key domain in the CMMC 2.0 framework that focuses on limiting access to authorized users, devices, and processes to protect sensitive information. This document outlines foundational practices, including AC.1.001 and AC.1.002, as well as essential concepts such as role-based access control (RBAC), the principle of least privilege, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Foundational Practices

### AC.1.001: Limit System Access
- **Description**: Organizations must limit system access to authorized users, devices, and processes.
- **Importance**: Ensures that only approved entities can interact with sensitive systems.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use unique user credentials for authentication.
  - Enforce device-level restrictions.
  - Regularly review system access logs.

---

### AC.1.002: Limit User Access
- **Description**: User access must be limited to authorized transactions and functions.
- **Importance**: Reduces security risks by ensuring users only access resources relevant to their role.
- **Implementation**:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Regular review and updates of user permissions.
  - Immediate deactivation of inactive accounts.

## Key Concepts

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Definition**: Assigns permissions to users based on their organizational roles.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies access management.
  - Reduces the potential for unauthorized access.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define clear roles with specific permissions.
  - Map users to their roles in the system.

---

### Principle of Least Privilege
- **Definition**: Users are granted only the access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces attack surfaces.
  - Minimizes the impact of breaches.
- **Implementation**:
  - Perform regular access audits.
  - Use automated tools to enforce access policies.

---

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Definition**: A security measure requiring two or more verification factors for access.
- **Benefits**:
  - Adds additional security layers.
  - Reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use hardware tokens, mobile apps, or biometrics.
  - Ensure all critical systems enforce MFA.

## Conclusion
The Access Control domain in CMMC 2.0 provides a foundation for safeguarding sensitive systems and data. By implementing practices such as AC.1.001 and AC.1.002, and adopting principles like RBAC and MFA, organizations can enhance their overall security posture.
