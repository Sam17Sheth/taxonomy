      Access Control (AC) is a key domain in the CMMC 2.0 framework that focuses
      on limiting access to authorized users, devices, and processes to protect
      sensitive information.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the focus of the Access Control domain in CMMC 2.0?
        answer: Access Control focuses on limiting access to authorized users, devices, and processes.
      - question: What is AC.1.001 in CMMC 2.0?
        answer: AC.1.001 requires organizations to limit system access to authorized users, devices, and processes.
      - question: Why is Access Control important?
        answer: Access Control ensures sensitive information is protected by limiting access to authorized entities.
  - context: |
      AC.1.002 focuses on limiting user access to authorized transactions and
      functions, ensuring minimal security risks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is AC.1.002 in CMMC 2.0?
        answer: AC.1.002 requires limiting user access to authorized transactions and functions.
      - question: How can AC.1.002 be implemented?
        answer: Through role-based access control, regular permission reviews, and deactivating inactive accounts.
      - question: What are the benefits of AC.1.002?
        answer: AC.1.002 minimizes security risks by ensuring users access only what they need.

      Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns permissions to users based on their roles within the organization.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is role-based access control (RBAC)?
        answer: RBAC assigns permissions to users based on their roles in the organization.
      - question: Why is RBAC useful?
        answer: RBAC simplifies access management and minimizes security risks.
      - question: How is RBAC implemented?
        answer: RBAC is implemented by mapping user roles to predefined access permissions.

      The principle of least privilege ensures users only have the access necessary
      to perform their job functions.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the principle of least privilege?
        answer: The principle ensures users only have access necessary for their roles.
      - question: Why is least privilege important?
        answer: It reduces potential attack surfaces and minimizes the impact of breaches.
      - question: How is least privilege enforced?
        answer: Through regular audits, access control policies, and automated tools.

      Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security measure requiring users to provide
      two or more verification factors for access.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is MFA?
        answer: MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors for access.
      - question: Why is MFA important?
        answer: MFA enhances security by adding additional authentication layers.
      - question: How can organizations implement MFA?
        answer: Organizations can implement MFA using tools like hardware tokens, mobile apps, or biometric systems.
