  - context: |
      Incident Response (IR) is a critical domain in the CMMC 2.0 framework that
      focuses on ensuring organizations are prepared to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the focus of the Incident Response domain in CMMC 2.0?
        answer: It ensures organizations can detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
      - question: Why is incident response important?
        answer: It minimizes damage from incidents and ensures faster recovery.
      - question: How does CMMC 2.0 enforce incident response?
        answer: By requiring organizations to establish and maintain incident response capabilities.
  - context: |
      IR.1.001 requires organizations to establish an incident response capability,
      including roles and responsibilities for incident response.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is IR.1.001 in CMMC 2.0?
        answer: IR.1.001 requires establishing an incident response capability.
      - question: What does IR.1.001 involve?
        answer: It involves defining roles and responsibilities for incident response.
      - question: Why is IR.1.001 significant?
        answer: It ensures a structured and effective response to incidents.
  - context: |
      An incident response plan (IRP) is a documented strategy for responding to
      cybersecurity incidents effectively.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is an incident response plan (IRP)?
        answer: Itâ€™s a documented strategy for managing and mitigating incidents.
      - question: What should an IRP include?
        answer: An IRP should include roles, responsibilities, and procedures for incident handling.
      - question: Why is an IRP necessary?
        answer: It ensures a structured and efficient response to incidents.
  - context: |
      Incident identification and reporting are key steps in incident response.
      Employees should be trained to recognize and report potential incidents.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are key steps in incident response?
        answer: Identification, reporting, and analyzing incidents are key steps.
      - question: Why is incident reporting important?
        answer: It helps organizations respond quickly and mitigate potential damage.
      - question: How can organizations improve incident reporting?
        answer: Through employee training and automated detection tools.
  - context: |
      Cybersecurity incident recovery involves restoring affected systems and
      data while preventing recurrence of the incident.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is cybersecurity incident recovery?
        answer: Recovery involves restoring systems and data while preventing recurrence.
      - question: Why is recovery essential in incident response?
        answer: It ensures systems are operational and reduces future risks.
      - question: What steps are involved in incident recovery?
        answer: Steps include system restoration, root cause analysis, and applying preventive measures.
